![Anna's Hummingbird](CalypteAnna.png)

Anna’s Hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a species of hummingbird most commonly observed in the Pacific Northwestern and coastal regions of North America. Distinctive for their small (10-11 cm) size, iridescent emerald bodies, and incredibly fast movement (up to 80 kph!) during a dive, Anna’s Hummingbirds are as well-known as they are appreciated by gardeners and bird watchers alike. Classified as “Least Concern” on the world-wide accepted species endangerment scale, the “Red List”; there are an estimated 9.6 million (and increasing) Anna’s Hummingbirds currently in existence.
